Jari's Procmail resources

        Hi, here are links to my world of the procmail, please select
        from the list below:
        
        o   #URL-BASE/pm-tips.html and text version under name
            #URL-BASE/pm-tips.txt
            This is a document containing all the relevant wisdom about
            procmail and what you need to know to use it efectively. The
            document also contains related topics like: Email headers,
            Anti Spam (aka UBE, UCE) discussion, tools (sendmail, Perl,
            relay) to fight against unsolicited Email.
        o   #URL-BASE/pm-code.html
            My contribution to the world of procmail. A 
            plug-in procmail module library that can be used like
            callable `functions'. Download at #URL-BASE/pm-code.zip
        o   I've written an *Emacs* minor mode *tinypm.el* that helps
            writing procmail files. The mode contains rather extensive lint
            (code checker) that can find mistakes from your procmail recipes.
            The package *tinypm.el* in included in my tiny-tools kit 
            <http://poboxes.com/jari.aalto/ema-tiny.html>

            pm.lint:073: Warning, Formail used but no `f' flag found.
                       
        I hope you the very best in the world of procmail and Philip
        Guenter for his always so helpful advices and hosting the
