        Hi, here are couple of links to the world of the procmail, please
        select from the list below:

        o   pm-tips.html includes documents sharing tips
            and discussing procmail module design and all that what you
            need to know to use procmail effectively. The document also
            contains related topics like: Email headers, Anti Spam (aka
            UBE, UCE) discussion, tools (sendmail, Perl, relay) to fight
            against unsolicited Email.
        o   pm-code.html
            Jari's contribution to the world of procmail. A
            plug-in procmail modules that can be used like
            callable `functions'.
        o   There is also an *Emacs* minor mode *tinyprocmail.el* that helps
            writing procmail files. The mode contains rather extensive lint
            (code checker) that can find mistakes from your procmail recipes.
            The Emacs package is in included in separate project at
            <http://freecode.net/projects/emacs-tiny-tools>. Here is
            output of test code check:

            *** 1997-11-24 22:13 (pm.lint) 3.11pre7 tinypm.el 1.80
            cd /users/jaalto/junk/
            pm.lint:010: Warning, no right hand variable found. ([$`']
            pm.lint:055: Pedantic, flag orer style is not standard `hW:'
            pm.lint:060: Warning, message dropped to folder, you need lock.
            pm.lint:062: Warning, recipe with "|" may need `w' flag.
            pm.lint:073: Warning, Formail used but no `f' flag found.

        I hope you the very best in the world of procmail and my sincere
        thanks to Philip Guenter for his always so helpful advices and
